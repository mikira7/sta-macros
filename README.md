For the NPC Crew and Ship Task Roller.

To add the macro your Foundry game, click on the hotbar to create a new macro, change the name to whatever you want, I suggest "NPC Crew and Ship Task", change the type to script and save.
For the macro to work you must select the ship token that you wish to roll from.
The macro will auto display the results and even tell you how much threat you gain!
